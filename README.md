A custom electronics control box I made for the parts needed to control a case feeder, bullet feeder and low primer warning on my reloading press.

See photos for parts layout and circuit diagram.

Internally, the control box is customized to mount:

1 x 2-channel relay: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0BYXWQXMD

There are also several holes for wires like power supply, sensors etc.
